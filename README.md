## BMI Calculator Writeup
### Course Project for Developing Data Products

This application is based on the New Body Mass Index (BMI) formula updated by researchers at Oxford University in 2013.

The revised formula (**1.3 x weight/height^2.5**) is a better approximation of the human body reality, because it scales more accurately as a person grows in height.

Users are required to input their height(*m*) and body weight(*kg*) to acquire the classification of their BMI scores.
